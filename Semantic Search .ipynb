      " Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.Â 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31. \n",

Scroll down for video . Egyptian officials left an African football event early after they were offended by a belly dancing performance byÂ Dina Talaat (above) A spokesman for the Egyptian Football Association confirmed that members left the venue once Mrs Talaat started her performance. They said: 'The association members were surprised at having this performance at such an international event.' A video of the performance has since gone viral online. The two-minute clip shows Mrs Talaat wearing a green and silver outfit as she shakes her belly and gyrates her hips. Soha Ebrahim, a sports host on Egyptian state television, described the clip as a 'scandal and a farce' in a comment on Facebook. But Mrs Talaat said she did not know what all the fuss was about, Gulf NewsÂ reported. She said: 'I was not the only dancer in the party. There were dancers from other nationalities too. 'I honoured Egypt and presented a respectable performance.' The ceremony on April 6 was attended by world football officials including FIFA President Sepp Blatter (above) The ceremony on April 6 was attended by world football officials including FIFA President Sepp Blatter. He stressed the importance of developing football in Africa in a speech and said: 'For me, Africa is my home and I have a strong affinity for African and African football.

The world's most expensive footballer and Real Madrid star Gareth Bale heads the list of those who have spent time in anywhere between the second and fourth tier of English football. He is joined by seven current Barclays Premier League players as well as three outfielders and a manager still plugging away in the Football League. Here's the team in full: . GOALKEEPER . Kasper Schmeichel (Darlington, Bury, Cardiff City, Coventry City, Notts County, Leeds United, Leicester City) Now with Leicester in the Premier League, Schmeichel has been named in as part of three Football League Team(s) of the Season and has promotions from League Two and the Championship on his CV. Now with Leicester in the Premier League, Kasper Schmeichel has been named in  three Team(s) of the Season . DEFENCE . Angel RangelÂ (Swansea City) Classy right back has risen from League One to the Premier League with Swansea, impressing in his four seasons in the Football League after moving from Spain. Classy right back Angel Rangel has risen from League One to the Premier League with Swansea City . Ashley Williams (Swansea City) Another player to be promoted twice with Swansea, Williams is now an established top-flight international centre back and captains his club and country. Ashley Williams is now an established top-flight international centre back and captains his club and country . Wes Morgan (Nottingham Forest, Leicester City) Always commanding in the centre of defence, Morgan has made over 400 Football League appearances across successful spells with Forest and Leicester. West Morgan has made over 400 Football League appearances with Nottingham Forest and Leicester City . Gareth Bale (Southampton) He only spent full one season in the lower divisions, but it would seem strange to leave Bale out of this team. He scored five goals from left back in the Championship back in 2006-07. Gareth BaleÂ only spent full one season in the lower divisions, but it would seem strange to leave him out . MIDFIELD . Wes Hoolahan (Blackpool, Norwich City) One of the Football League's best midfielders consistently, Hoolahan has sandwiched three years in the top flight with time in the lower leagues and could be in line for a fourth promotion this season. Wes Hoolahan has been one of the Football League's best midfielders consistently with Blackpool and Norwich . Adam LallanaÂ (Southampton, Bournemouth) Now at Liverpool, Lallana rose through the ranks with Southampton and moved from League One to the Premier League with back-to-back promotions in 2011 and 2012. AdamÂ Lallana rose through the ranks with Southampton and moved from League One to the Premier League . Peter Whittingham (Derby County, Cardiff City) The only non-striker to top the scoring charts, in the 2009-10 season, Whittingham has been a constant presence for Cardiff since moving from Aston Villa in 2007. PeterÂ Whittingham has been a constant presence for Cardiff since moving from Aston Villa in 2007 . FORWARDS . Glenn Murray (Carlisle United, Stockport County, Rochdale, Brighton & Hove Albion, Crystal Palace, Reading) He's been consistently knocking in the goals for clubs across the Football League for years, and now Murray is finally getting a real chance at the Premier League with Crystal Palace - and he's taking it well. Glenn Murray has been consistently knocking in the goals for clubs across the Football League for years . Rickie Lambert (Rochdale, Bristol Rovers, Southampton) Nobody has scored more goals (153) in the Football League over the last 10 years than Lambert, so he is a no-brainer for this side. Nobody has scored more goals (153) in the Football League over the last 10 years than Rickie Lambert . Jordan Rhodes (Ipswich Town, Rochdale, Brentford, Huddersfield Town, Blackburn Rovers) So prolific in the lower divisions, Rhodes became the most expensive Football League transfer when he joined Blackburn and is regularly linked with a move to the top flight. Prolific striker Jordan Rhodes became the most expensive Football League transfer when he joined Blackburn . MANAGER . Eddie Howe (Bournemouth, Burnley) Two brilliant spells with Bournemouth sandwich a brief stint with Burnley for Howe, who looks like he may be a Premier League manager next season.

As of April 1, the licensing system for agents is to change so that anyone can become a football agent as long as they pay Â£500 for an initial one-year registration period. The FA will then charge Â£250 for every subsequent year of renewal. Already established licensed agents were exempt. The FA is due to place a link on their website for intermediaries to register, but as of 1pm that was still not in place. Mel Stein thinks the new regulations on becoming a football agent will 'create anarchy' The new guidelines have come in after FIFA effectively washed their hands of governing agents. FIFA recommendations include national associations registering only intermediaries of 'impeccable character', all deals annually published online, agents' fees limited to three per cent and no monies earned by them for negotiating deals for players under the age of 18. The FA, Premier League and Football League have been discussing how best to cope with FIFA opting out. All have serious concerns about how the system will work in Britain and abroad, especially in under-developed football territories. Mel Stein, chairman of the London-based Association of Football Agents, told the Guardian: 'I think it's going to create anarchy and everybody is going to be sorry about it. FIFA couldn't cope so they decided to hand it over to the individual territories. Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao (right) with his agent Jorge Mendes pictured last year . 'I can see the bloke in the pub who knows a parent or a footballer's dad saying 'I'll represent you' and then undercutting everyone.' 'It is clearly wrong and anti-competitive to have this kind of price-capping. The FA are saying we've got to do it because that's what FIFA are telling us to do. The three per cent cap will destroy the business of probably 50% of my members.' AFA (Association of Football Agents) has been holding discussions to reach a compromise and have pushed for self regulating. James Featherstone of OmniSports said: 'It's a big worry for clubs how they keep a check on who is who. These new rules will allow anyone to register as an intermediary acting on behalf of a player.'\n",
      "6107    Four Queens Park Rangers supporters have been jailed for football-related disorder following an incident with Burnley fans last year. The unsavoury scenes occurred on February 1, 2014 following a 3-3 draw during their Championship encounter at Loftus Road. The foursome identified as Harry Childs, Jack Hutchins, Dean Foreman and Bradley Pack were sentenced for affray on Friday, after being charged in July last year, due to their involvement in an act of violent disorder outside a west London pub. QPR fans Harry Childs (left) and Jack Hutchins have been jailed for football-related disorder last year . Dean Foreman (left) and Bradley Pack were also sentenced for affray on Friday for their involvement . The incident occurred after last season's 3-3 draw between QPR and Burnley at Loftus Road . Childs, 18 from Billericay, Essex has been sentenced to eight months imprisonment while Hutchins, 21 of Kings Langley, Hertfordshire was given a one-year sentence alongside 27-year-old Foreman who hails from Northolt, London. Pack, 22 of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire was sentenced to 30 weeks imprisonment. In addition all four men also received six-year Football Banning Orders under section 23 of the Football Spectators Act 1989. Childs, Hutchins and Foreman were found guilty of the offences on March 6 with Pack previously entering a guilty plea. During the two-week trial, the court heard how the quartet gathered outside the the Plough and Harrow pub shortly before 5pm, where they confronted a number of Burnley supporters, who were having a post-match drink, through the windows outside the establishment. The incident  dates back to February 2014 when the quartetÂ confronted Burnley supporters after their match . With the shouting reciprocated from within, the events soon escalated to violence and the pub's window being kicked and shattered by Childs. The ensuing scenes saw numerous people assaulted and punched outside the pub, with the Plough and Harrow manager locking the glass front doors and calling 999 in fear of the violence spreading into the premises. Childs - who was wearing a distinctive red patent jacket - and his three associates moved up along Kings Street where they came across another set of Burnley and QPR supporters where further spontaneous violence took place. Police soon arrived at the scene, however Hutchins and Foreman evaded their attention. Childs and Pack were stopped nearby where they identified themselves to the police, but they were not arrested as there was no evidence to support their involvement in the disorder at the time. The foursome attacked the Plough and Harrow pub as the shouting soon turned into violence in west London . An investigation was immediately launched by detectives from Hammersmith and Fulham with support from specialist officers from the Central Football Policing unit. Hours of CCTV were carefully in a bid to identify those responsible for the disorder with Childs, Hutchins, Foreman and Pack and all arrested on suspicion of violent disorder on June 9, 2014. Chief Inspector Simon Causer said: 'This kind of behaviour is entirely unacceptable to the police, the thousands of law-abiding and genuine football fans, the clubs and the general public. Our hope is that, in light of these convictions and sentences, perpetrators will think very carefully about the consequences of their actions before carrying out football violence. 'Our borough has a proud history in policing successful match day operations and we have extensive experience working together with our residents and businesses to ensure that our communities are safe and able to enjoy this great sport. The quartet later moved up along Kings Street where further acts of violence and disorder took place . Hours of CCTV were carefully in a bid to identify those responsible for the disorder . 'With continued support from our football clubs and local partners we remain resolute in our zero-tolerance policy towards football related violence and we utterly condemn such actions.' PC Paul Todd, from the Met's Central Football Unit, said: 'Football violence has reduced over the years but there are still a minority that insist on putting people at risk by fighting in busy streets near members of public. People arrested for football violence do not only get a criminal record but can also receive an order preventing them from attending football matches in the future.' A spokesperson for QPR, said: 'The vast majority of QPR fans are excellent ambassadors and passionate supporters. However the club takes a zero tolerance position to violence in or around the stadium and will continue to fully cooperate with the police in these rare instances.'\n",

Players including Vincent Kompany and Gael Clichy helped youngsters add the finishing touches to the design during a street party on Wednesday - alongside women's players Lucy Bronze and Emma Lipman and Mathias Bossaerts and Kelechi Iheanacho from the Elite Development Squad. The mural has been inspired by young City fans around the world to reflect the positive influence that the game has brought to their lives. Manchester-based artists groups Outhouse used the pictures to design the huge mural, which took almost four weeks to complete. Captain Vincent Kompany helps a young City fan put the finishing touches to the massive mural . The 64metre design covers the south edge of the Premier League champion's Academy Stadium . City stars joined around 100 local schoolchildren for a street party to unveil the mural . Among the images featured are scenes of football being played around the world, including night football, street football and disabled leagues, while the club's City Football Academy is at the centre of the design. Captain Kompany felt privileged to be a part of unveiling: 'It's been a special street party event today and the wall looks incredible. When Manchester City Women's and our EDS teams play at the Academy Stadium, our fans will be able to see City's history and future reflected in this wall,' he said. Kompany and women's player Lucy Bronze give the mural the thumbs up with some young fans . Gael Clichy was also at hand to pose for pictures with youngsters at the mural's unveiling . 'Being at the City Football Academy, in the heart of Manchester means that we have a greater bond with the community and the surrounding areas and today's event showed this connection in action.' The Premier League champions, along with sister clubs including New York City FC and Melbourne City FC, recently invested Â£400,000 into a charitable programme, Cityzens Giving, aimed at extending the 'football effect' to areas of need across the globe.

Liam Marshall-Ascough is standing to be an MP in Stoke-on-Trent central, which had a 5,500 Labour majority in 2010, and is a traditional Labour stronghold. The candidate, who is gay, is pictured on the open profile of his Facebook page appearing to lick a female friend's breasts. Underneath the picture a friend commented 'drunko'. But Mr Marshall-Ascough has insisted the photos, taken seven years ago, just show him out having fun with close friends 'like a normal person' and do not undermine his ability to do the job. He also said they show he is able to interact with people - important to the role of a politician. Liam Marshall-Ascough, pictured seven years ago on a night out with a close friend, insists the pictures show him enjoying himself like any normal person in their twenties and do not undermine his ability to do the job . 'You are still allowed to go out with your friends,' he told MailOnline. 'I think it's really important that you have a balance. You are not just about politics, but you actually interact with people. 'You can balance your social life and your professional life' Other photographs show him out drinking and posing with several female friends under the title 'more random nights out', and withÂ and colleagues at Virgin Atlantic where he works as a steward. Mr Marshall-Ascough is also seen posing with David Cameron and outside the front door of Number 10, in pictures on the site. 'I'm a normal person,' he added in response to claims that some people felt the pictures showed a lack of judgement and responsibility. 'I grew up in a council house and I have a job that's cabin crew. It's a very sociable job and I'm a very sociable person.Â 'I think that's important. 'One of the things that I love about being cabin crew is you get to interact with people from every walk of life, and I think that's really important to the job of a politician. 'People want politicians these days who are normal people.' Mr Marshall-Ascough is a Conservative candidate for Stoke-on-Trent central, a traditional Labour stronghold . Several photographs show Mr Marshall-Ascough enjoyong nights out with his friends . Mr Marshall-Ascough, now 35, said the pictures had been taken seven years ago when he was out with close friends and was enjoying himself like most people in their twenties. He also added that he is not drinking to excess in any of the pictures, or doing anything wrong. 'I don't hide the fact I'm a normal person, and people want politicians who are normal,' he added. 'I'm definitely not going out at the moment. I'm too busy. 'You have to remember these pictures were taken in my twenties, when I was out like other people. Now I am in my thirties. 'Sometimes you make misjudgements when you are younger and you learn from these and grow up, using these experiences.' Mr Marshall-Ascough said he is able to balance his personal and professional life to interact with people . The Crawley borough councillor hasn't used any privacy settings on his social media profile, so the images are viewable by the public. The 35-year-old has also recently been seen on the campaign trail, supporting other Conservative party candidates.Â He faces a challenge to get elected in his constituency, which has been a Labour stronghold since the 1950s. His female friend, who appears in one of the photos but did not want to be named, said: 'It was taken seven years ago and it was harmless fun. It just happens to be a picture taken out of context. There was nothing untoward. It was all very innocent and Liam is a really professional person.' Mr Marshall-Ascough courted controversy last year when he told his local newspaper that he did not believe there was a cost of living crisis. He said he felt an extra food bank was not needed in the borough because he believed there was no food poverty, as shown by the fact it was 'difficult' to book a table in Crawley on a Friday or Saturday evening. Mr Marshall-Ascough, who studied Archaeology and History at the University of Southampton, made a start in politics in 2012 when he was elected to the council. He was picked as the Conservative party candidate for Stoke-on Trent in October last year and insisted he will not be standing down as a councillor for Southgate, where he has a seat until 2016. He also insisted that residents of Southgate - located almost 200 miles from Stoke-on-Trent, will not suffer if he is elected as an MP. He described being chosen to stand as an MP as 'an honour and a privilege'.\n",

Arsenal man Wilshere tweeted a picture of himself getting ready to attend the ceremony, writing alongside the image: 'we're on our way, see you soon!' Wilshere is closing in on full fitness and a return to the Arsenal team after a long lay-off after ankle surgery in November, but took time out to enjoy the event alongside some fellow Premier League players. Southampton defenders Clyne and Bertrand arrived with speculation mounting that Clyne could be set to depart the south-coast club at the end of the Premier League season. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman admitted that he wants to know the plans of the England international in a maximum of 10 days time. Other sporting stars such as Rebecca Adlington, Sam Warburton and David Weir made an appearance, as well as racing driver Carmen Jorda.

Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of software services exporter Satyam Computers Services, was also fined $804,000, R.K. Gaur, a spokesman for India's Central Bureau of Investigation, told CNN. In 2009, Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $1.6 billion fraud case after its then-chairman Raju admitted inflating profits with fictitious assets and nonexistent cash. Investigators say losses to investors resulting from the company's book manipulation were much higher. A special court convicted Raju and nine other people of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust and other charges, said the Central Bureau of Investigation, which looked into the case. In the media, the case has been compared to the 2001 Enron Corp. scandal, in which a Houston energy company's earnings had been overstated by several hundred million dollars. When the scam made headlines, Satyam, which means \"truth\" in Sanskrit, was India's fourth-largest software services provider. It was serving almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generated more than half of its revenue from the United States. The company had about 53,000 employees and operated in 65 countries. After Raju's shock disclosures six years ago, the Indian government fired Satyam's board. In a subsequent state-backed auction, the company was bought by Tech Mahindra, part of the country's Mahindra Group. A heavyweight of the nation's software industry, Raju, 60, has been in jail for the past 32 months. He had founded Satyam in 1987. His company made giant strides as the outsourcing business grew in India in the 1990s.\n",

'We know she made her own perfumes and would certainly have worn it to increase her powers of seduction,' says Mandy Aftel, perfume historian and author of Fragrant: The Secret Life Of Scent. 'She didn't solely rely on her looks. Cleopatra believed that smelling divine was the real key to a man's heart,' she says. And according to scientists, Cleopatra was right. Perfume really can make us more attractive. 'Humans are mammals and though we're highly evolved, we have inherited mating mechanisms from the animal kingdom. One of the factors that influences our partner choice is smell,' says Tim Jacob, emeritus professor at the School of Biosciences at Cardiff University. We react in an involuntary way to smell because our noses are connected to synapses in the unconscious part of the brain (the piriform cortex), which governs the subconscious mind. 'The power of the subconscious mind is extremely strong. If we like someone's smell, they become instantly more attractive to us, and vice versa,' says Roja Dove, master perfumer at Urban Retreat Perfumerie in Harrods. Small wonder, then, that perfumers spend vast amounts of time and money creating fragrances that evoke positive feelings of satisfaction and sensuality. And there are ingredients with a proven track record of evoking other strong subconscious reactions. Perfumers spend vast amounts of time and money creating fragrances that evoke positive feelings of satisfaction and sensuality . 'Vanilla, an ingredient in many perfumes, is a smell that's strongly associated with pleasure,' says Professor Jacob. 'Just think of confectionery and the feelings of happiness that go with traditional childhood treats.' Lavender, another common ingredient in perfume, has been shown to calm and soothe the mind, while citrus smells evoke images of health and cleanliness. So powerful is our unconscious reaction to smell that perfumers claim wearing certain scents will make a woman seem younger, more athletic or even slimmer than she actually is. So what are the perfect perfumes to make others think we're slim, sexy, sporty or sophisticated? Harrods' Roja Dove picks his favourites . . . FLIRT WITH FLORALS . Floral perfumes can take years off a woman, as long as the smell is subtle. However, if it's cloying or overpowering, the effect can be ageing. Anything that overwhelms our senses can begin to smell stale and musty, and these are scents that the unconscious mind associates with age. Vivacious yet subtle scents of peony, lily of the valley and orange blossom will evoke images of spring and youth. Perfumes such as Balenciaga's Florabotanica (Â£56, Debenhams) or Love Story from Chloe (Â£65, Debenhams) use floral notes that create an impression of youthful energy. They're flirty and fun, like actresses Helen Mirren and Felicity Kendal. RAMP UP YOUR SEX APPEAL . Vanilla is an aphrodisiac that enhances sensations of pleasure across the central nervous system. Therefore, it's no wonder that so many perfumes use vanilla as a base note. Perfumes with a bright, breezy, citrus scent evoke images of health, youth and the outdoors . Applied to the nape of the neck or dabbed lightly behind the ears, the smell is intensely seductive. For serious sex appeal you need a slightly heavier scent, one which comes from the perfume group we call the Orientals. These are perfumes based on vanilla with touches of sandalwood, patchouli or coumarin, which is found in conker beans. The fragrances are sensual - they speak of arousal and passion. Think rich, luxuriant velvet as opposed to bright, clean cotton. Try Guerlain's Shalimar, (Â£62, John Lewis), L'Ambre Des Merveilles by Hermes (Â£82, House of Fraser) or Armani's Si (Â£64, John Lewis) for a date night your husband won't forget. WAFT AWAYÂ THE YEARS . Perfumes with a bright, breezy, citrus scent evoke images of health, youth and the outdoors. Lemon has long been associated with a fresh, youthful vivacity, so perfumes with citrus notes combined with florals will have associations of vigour and energy. Opt for perfumes such as Tom Ford's Private Blend White Suede (Â£142, John Lewis) or Givenchy's Dahlia Noir (Â£63, Boots) to knock the pounds off in an instant. You may never run a marathon, but you'll smell like someone who does (in a good way). SMART AND SASSY AROMAS . If you've got a tricky meeting or job interview, you'll want to appear calm, competent and chic. The fragrance equivalent of an exquisitely tailored Chanel suit is a perfume from the Chypre family. This group of fragrances is blended with uncompromising clarity, made up primarily of woody scents: juniper, cedarwood and bergamot and citrus top notes. Nearly 80 per cent ofÂ women who useÂ fragranceÂ ownÂ two to tenÂ bottles . Cartier's Eau De Cartier (Â£46, House of Fraser) or Bottega Veneta Essence Aromatique (Â£60, John Lewis) are perfect examples of understated statement perfumes. If a perfume can make you appear to be the sort of person who reads Proust at bedtime rather than Hello! magazine, it's going to be one of these. GIVE YOURSELF A MOOD LIFT . Clean, energising citrus notes with hints of healing, soothing jasmine and lavender work best to dispel gloom, spread joy and your spirits. These scents have been shown to have anti-depressant and rebalancing effects. It really is true that a little lavender essence sprinkled on your pillow at night will help you sleep peacefully, leaving you calm and re-energised for the day ahead. Try Clarins' Eau Dynamisante (Â£39, John Lewis), Fendi's L'Aquarossa (Â£64, Harrods) or, for a really lovely lavender feel, Marc Jacobs' Daisy Eau So Fresh (Â£72, Debenhams).\n",

The Greek government has put forward a bill which could see sporting events cancelled due to incidents of crowd violence and teams prohibited from playing in European competition. UEFA and FIFA say that is direct government interference in football and have threatened to suspend Greece. Panathinakos' game against Olympiakos in February was marred by crowd trouble in Athens . Greek government have proposed new laws banning teams from European competitions, but UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino says they are not allowed to directly interfere with football . Infantino said: 'Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference. 'There are currently three other countries, outside of Europe, which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football. 'Don't forget that it will affect more than the national team. If your clubs don't play in our competitions, their coefficient will also drop, meaning that less teams can qualify for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.' UEFA and FIFA sent a final letter of warning on Wednesday but the Greek government is refusing to back down. Greece's deputy sports minister Stavros Kontonis told Greek television on Wednesday night: 'We are not going to change the philosophy of the sports bill.

Torpedo supporters showed the flag during the club's 3-1 win over Arsenal Tula on Sunday. The punishment will not take effect until May because Torpedo are already required to play their next two home games behind closed doors for a separate incident in which fans abused Zenit St Petersburg striker Hulk with monkey chants. Sunday's clash between Torpedo Moscow and Arsenal Tula was marred by violence and racism . A fan lays on the ground after being attacked by rival supporters during Torpedo's latest away game . Sunday's game was also marred by crowd violence, with Torpedo fans attacking Arsenal supporters and police. For that, Torpedo fans will be barred from the club's next three away games, with the exception of women and children under 13. Torpedo was fined a total of 900,000 rubles (Â£11,000) for various offenses including the Nazi banner, the fighting, use of pyrotechnics by fans, and insulting chants. Arsenal received a 480,000-ruble (Â£6,000) fine on charges including failing to secure the stadium properly. Police detained 15 fans at the game, of which seven face charges, Russian agency Tass reported on Monday. In response to the incidents at Sunday's game, Torpedo president Alexander Tukmanov told the R-Sport agency that the club's fans seemed to be 'probably the most aggressive' of any top-flight Russian team. Torpedo's previous three racism offenses this season all involved monkey chants against opposition players. Torpedo are already due to play their next two home games behind closed doors after aiming monkey chants at Zenit St Petersburg during their fixture last month . Club were also punished after fans abused Dynamo Moscow defender Christopher Samba earlier in season . The latest punishment comes a week after the Russian Football Union appointed its first dedicated anti-racism inspector, who is tasked with gathering evidence to punish clubs for racism-related incidents at matches. A report by two anti-discrimination organizations last month said there were more than 200 cases of discriminatory behavior linked to Russian soccer over two seasons, as the country prepares to host the 2018 World Cup. Separately on Tuesday, Zenit coach Andre Villas-Boas was given a suspended one-game ban by the Russian Football Union for repeatedly breaking rules on leaving his technical area at games throughout the season.\n",

The 58-year-old Italian's departure comes six days after Leeds' assistant head coach Steve Thompson was suspended. Cellino, banned from having any executive influence at Elland Road until May 4 due to a tax conviction in Italy, told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'He resigned. I'm not there so I don't know why. Nicola Salerno (right) has resigned from his role as Leeds United's sporting director . 'I wanted him to stay and speak about it first when I got back to Leeds but he made the decision. This is the situation.' Salerno, who worked with Cellino at his previous club Cagliari, has been reported in Italy to be lined up to become sporting director at Serie A club Palermo. Leeds United assistant manager Steve Thompson (left) was been suspended by the club last week . Thompson's suspension has left manager Neil Redfearn considering his future at Elland Road . He arrived at Elland Road last summer following the completion of Cellino's club takeover in March last year. When Leeds were contacted they were unable to comment on the matter. It is understood Salerno was responsible for the departure of Thompson, who joined Leeds as head coach Neil Redfearn's assistant in December. Thompson has made no comment since his suspension and is currently consulting with the League Managers' Association.\n",
